\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
Write an introduction of your work here. Do not forget to indicate what can be found in the different Sections of the report.

\section{Methods and Materials}\label{methods}
Here you should describe the methods and materials used for your report. Do not explain all details, but provide enough explanation so that a person who is well-grounded in statistics understands what you have done. You can make subsections using the \verb|\subsection| command.

\section{Result}\label{result}
Put the results of your work here. All figures and tables that are included in the paper should be well-designed, include proper legends, and be easy to interpret for the reader.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}
Put the Discussion of your work here. Think about what the results imply for your initial research question.

\begin{thebibliography}{9}
% You are free to use whatever reference style you prefer (Harvard, APA, Vancouver, etc.), but be consistent, i.e., always use the same reference style across the whole paper.

\section*{Appendix - R/SAS code}\label{appendix}
Only relevant R/SAS code should be included in the Appendix (i.e., code of the essential statistical models, not the code to obtain Figures, Tables, or descriptive statistics). You can, for example, use the \verb|\verbatim| command to this purpose.\\

R code for a simple summation:
\begin{verbatim}
s = 0
for (i in 1:100){
  s = s + i
}
s
\end{verbatim}
